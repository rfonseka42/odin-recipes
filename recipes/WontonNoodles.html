    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Wonton Noodle Soup is one of my all-time favorites, and it was actually one of the recipes I really wanted to
        share when we started this channel, because my parents made this basically every other day for me as a kid. Like
        many of you, this dish brings up a ton of nostalgia for me.</p>
    <p>Here are a list of ingredients and directions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz wonton noodles (fresh, unsteamed)</li>
        <li>30 wontons</li>
        <li>12 oz bok choy</li>
        <li>1 piece green onion</li>
        <li>8 pieces shrimp (peeled)</li>
        <li>14 oz chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>CHOP VEGETABLES</strong>
            <p>We'll start by washing and cutting our bok choy (12 oz) into quarters along
                the stem. Then, we'll chop our green onions (1 piece) into small pieces. (Assuming our shrimp (8 pieces)
                are
                already deveined and peeled, we don't need to do anything to them.)</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>COOK NOODLES</strong>
            <p>Set the stove to high heat and bring a pot of water to a boil. We'll want to
                use more water so that the noodles cook faster, which leads to a more chewy, springy texture.</p>
            <p>Spread the noodles (15 oz) out so they don't clump up when cooking.</p>
            <p>With the stove still set to high heat, let the noodles cook in the boiling water for about 60 seconds.
                Then, dunk them in cold water for a few seconds. After dunking them in cold water, we'll place them in
                the
                pot again for about 15-20 seconds.</p>
            <p>Transfer the noodles to a bowl. We'll add a bit of olive oil (1 tbsp) to the noodles and mix it around.
            </p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>CREATE BROTH AND COOK BAK CHOY</strong>
            <p>For our broth, we'll add water (4 cups) and chicken broth (14
                oz) to the pot, and bring it to a boil.</p>
            <p>Once boiling, we'll add olive oil (1 tbsp), which helps the bok choy keep its green color, along with
                some
                salt (1 tsp). The bubbles might rise rapidly once you do this, so be careful!</p>
            <p>Throw in the bok choy, stir for a bit, and cover the pot. With our stove still on high heat, we'll let
                the
                bok choy cook for about 1-2 minutes until the pot returns to a boil.</p>
            <p>Then, we'll add fish sauce (1 tbsp) (a ton of umami!), sesame oil (1 tsp), and white pepper (0.25 tsp).
                Taste to see if you need any adjustments.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>COOK SHRIMP, TRANSFER BAK CHOY</strong>
            <p>We'll dump the shrimp in as we start plating the bok choy on top of the noodles.</p>
            <p>The shrimp only need about a minute to cook. You can tell they're ready once they've turned orange. When
                ready, plate the shrimp on the noodles.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>COOK wontons</strong>
            <p>We have a whole recipe and video on this, but if you're starting with raw wontons, you'll boil them for
                about 3-5 minutes until they start floating. We have some additional pro-tips for cooking in our wonton
                video so be sure to check the video out if you haven't seen it already.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>PLATE</strong>
            <p>Transfer the wontons onto the bowl of noodles, and carefully pour in the soup broth. Garnish with green
                onions. Call your loved ones over! Time to eat :)</p>
